## Christine Youngwon Kim

Hello! I am a graduate student in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at The Pennsylvania State University. My research focuses on several questions: 
- relationships between parents in the transition to parenthood, such as coparenting and marital relationships 
- parent and overall family mental health and well-being in the transition to parenthood 
- infant-parent attachment relationships 

In my free time, I like to hang out on the couch with my dog and husband, read fiction, watch TV shows, and go on walks.
